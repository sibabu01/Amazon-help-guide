## Introduction
Welcome! I am _Sivachandran Babu_ (Technical writer) and I have created an **Amazon Help Guide** using `DITA 1.3` specification in Oxygen XML authoring tool. As I am attending interviews, I would like to show off my basic writing skills to *HR recruiters* for initial screening purposes.
